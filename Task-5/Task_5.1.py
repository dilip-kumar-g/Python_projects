1. What is the output of the below python code ?

data = [10,501,22,37,100,999,87,351]

result = filter(lambda x: x > 4, data)

print("Output = "list(result))

'''


output = [10, 501, 22, 37, 100, 999, 87, 351]

The output would be the same as the every other element in the list passes the condition and return the same value 

So the list that is given as input is the output too.
